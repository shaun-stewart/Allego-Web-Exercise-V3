Currently the demo web app will only run when served from a local server. This is due to the use of ES6 modules.
I used a Live Server plugin for Visual Studio Code to launch a local server so I could view and test on various browsers.

Unfortunately I didn't have the time necessary to polish up this submission.
Due to work and child care commitments, I only had a small portion of the evening to finish this task. 

Hopefully I have demonstrated enough knowledge of JS, CSS and HTML to continue through to the next stage of the interview process
where I can demo the web app and we can discuss some of the points I have noted below.

Serving the webapp
Tests / TDD
Frameworks
Importing/Parsing files (for menu etc)
Split up of logic (presenter, view)
Doc frags faster than innerHtml
queryselector should only be used with ids (not class names)
Naming conventions
Responsiveness
Serving the webapp
Was Number("'3") meant to be like that in the loadContent method?
Dialog does not revert content after closing
px vs em
General styling
